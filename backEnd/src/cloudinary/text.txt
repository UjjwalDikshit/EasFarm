Excellent question 👌
This is where most developers make mistakes.



 🎯 Short Answer

Use `getUploadSignature` when:

> 🔥 You want the **frontend to upload directly to Cloudinary**
> 🔥 Especially for **large files (like 1GB videos)**
> 🔥 Or when you want better scalability



 🧠 Why It Exists

Normally:

Frontend → Your Server → Cloudinary

For small images (2MB, 5MB), this is fine.

But for:

* 🎥 500MB–1GB videos
* 📄 Large PDFs
* High traffic uploads

This becomes:

* Slow
* Expensive (server bandwidth)
* Memory heavy
* Not scalable



 🚀 When You SHOULD Use getUploadSignature

 ✅ 1️⃣ Large Video Uploads (Your 1GB Case)

Uploading 1GB through your server is a bad idea.

Instead:

Frontend → Cloudinary (direct upload)

But to keep it secure, Cloudinary requires a **signature**.

That signature is generated by:

getUploadSignature()



 ✅ 2️⃣ High Traffic Systems

If 100 users upload videos simultaneously:

Without direct upload:

* Your server handles 100GB traffic
* Server may crash

With signed upload:

* Cloudinary handles it
* Your server only signs request (very lightweight)



 ✅ 3️⃣ Mobile Apps

Mobile → Direct Cloudinary upload
Faster + more reliable



 ❌ When NOT To Use It

You DON'T need signature if:

* Small images (< 10MB)
* Admin-only uploads
* Low traffic
* Internal tools

Then simple backend upload is fine.



 🔐 What getUploadSignature Actually Does

It generates:

{
  "timestamp": 1710000000,
  "signature": "abcxyz123",
  "apiKey": "xxxx",
  "cloudName": "xxxx"
}

Frontend uses this to upload securely to:

https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<cloud_name>/auto/upload



 🏗 Your Case Recommendation

You said:

* 🎥 Video up to 1GB
* 🖼 Image 20MB
* 📄 PDF 50MB

 ✅ Recommended Architecture:

| File          | Method                |
| - |  |
| Image         | Normal backend upload |
| PDF           | Backend upload        |
| Video (large) | Signed direct upload  |

This is how large platforms do it.



 🔥 Real-World Rule

If file > 100MB → use signed direct upload
If file < 20MB → backend upload is fine



 🏁 Final Simple Meaning

`getUploadSignature` is used when:

> You want frontend to upload directly to Cloudinary securely, without passing file through your server.



If you want, I can now show you:

* 🔥 Full direct signed upload frontend + backend flow
* 🔥 Chunk upload for very large videos
* 🔥 Secure upload type restriction in signed upload
* 🔥 Production-ready direct upload architecture
